 Detecting Moving Objects Project:
 
 Introduction:
The Detecting Moving Objects Project is a computer vision system that uses image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect and track moving objects in a video stream or image sequence. This system can be used for surveillance systems, autonomous driving, and robotics applications.

Installation:
To install the project, follow these steps:
1)Clone the repository to your local machine.
2)Install the required dependencies, including OpenCV, Python, and TensorFlow.
3)Run the main.py file to start the object detection and tracking system.

Usage:
To use the object detection and tracking system, follow these steps:
1)Run the main.py file to start the system.
2)Select the video or image data to be used for object detection and tracking.
3)Wait for the system to detect and track moving objects in real-time.
4)Evaluate the performance of the system using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
